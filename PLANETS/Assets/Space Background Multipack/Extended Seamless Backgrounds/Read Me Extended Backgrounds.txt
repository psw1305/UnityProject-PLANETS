These scenes make use of a shader to attempt to seamlessly merge multiple images. If you want more or less images you will have to edit the shader and make your own version!

Currently there is no clean or easy way to make this shader dynamic that I know of except possibly with a texture atlas (See our other product Mip Map Maker). I may experiment with this for a future update
